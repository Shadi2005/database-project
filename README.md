# database-project

## Description
This academic project focuses on designing and implementing a relational database system for a university's Library and Education Center.

## Features 
- **Schema Design**:  
  - Two well-structured schemas: `Library` and `EducationCenter`  
  - Tables normalized up to **Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF)** for optimal data consistency

- **Procedural Logic**:  
  - Implementation of **triggers**, **stored procedures**, and **user-defined functions**  
  - Two main procedures:
    - **Course Recommendation** within the `EducationCenter` schema  
    - **Book Suggestion** within the `Library` schema  

- **Access Control**:  
  - Simulation of role-based permissions for multiple user types (e.g., Admin, Librarian, Student)  
  - Enforcement of data security and privilege restrictions

- **Data Integration**:  
  - Bulk **import/export** of data using Excel files via `BULK INSERT` and other SQL Server commands  
  - Integration of one core procedure within an **SSIS environment** for ETL demonstration
